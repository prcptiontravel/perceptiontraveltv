We create `inspiring` and `uplifting` media from your footage.

We serve `communities`, `brands`, and `individuals` who share the values of `ethical`, `regenerative`, and `intentional` business practices. Our services are based on the **value4value** ethos, because your uplifting stories deserve to be shared.

Check out our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@perceptiontraveltv) and help us get monetized by watching some videos.


## Submit Your Footage and Ideas

You send us your footage (smartphone, camera, drone, whatever) and we'll work with you to tell an engaging story with a call-to-action (if necessary). Here are some samples:

## Our Story

Since 2014, weâ€™ve helped produce over `100 "smiling media"` videos in `15+ countries` on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@perceptiontraveltv). In that time we've discovered that anyone with a smartphone can be the filmmaker, but not everyone is ready to work on their footage and edit it into something digestible. We tried to be a 501(c)3 non-profit but it just wasn't cool.

Profit-motivated media manipulate the stories of our world. We believe that working `together` to share powerful stories can enhance our perception of other `people`, `cultures`, and `efforts` to make the world a better place... so that's why we want to help you edit your video.

We also tried building a FOSS, PHP-based <a href="https://perceptions.live">media networking platform, but ran out of steam. If you're curious to help us haul it back onto the rails, <a href="mailto:hello@perceptiontravel.tv">let us know</a>.
